# Video Documentation (W.I.P)

Welcome to my personal documentation of Minecraft's technical side ranging from commands to functions to resourcepacks, and perhaps datapacks if I am brave enough one day.

> This website is currently a work in progress, so it doesn't have all of the documentation as of right now, but soon enough I'll include more. Usually there is a piece of documentation for each video I make on Youtube.
